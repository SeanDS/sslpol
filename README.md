Point of load DC-DC converter for powering a Raspberry Pi Zero and peripherals.

This circuit contains a Texas Instruments LMR33640 synchronous buck converter to convert a 6-36 VDC input to a
(nominally) 5 VDC @ up to 4 A output. The design is based on datasheet recommendations. It also includes a
footprint for a Raspberry Pi Zero to be attached on the rear side, face-down, and the 5 VDC rail provides it
with power. This allows a Raspberry Pi and a large external load (such as a string of LEDs) to be powered
from one supply, overcoming the 500 mA current limit from the Pi's 5 VDC rail.

## Features
- 1-24 VDC @ up to 4 A output, configurable via resistors
- 3.8-36 VDC input range
- Header for a Raspberry Pi Zero with its 5 VDC rail attached to the output of the converter (warning: only use
  a Raspberry Pi when the output is configured to be 5 VDC, via R2 and R3)
- Headers for attached devices using SPI, I2C and FTDI protocols
- Converter pin compatibility with the LMR33610, LMR33620, LMR33630, LMR36510 and LMR36520
- Small footprint 30 Ã— 65 mm board
